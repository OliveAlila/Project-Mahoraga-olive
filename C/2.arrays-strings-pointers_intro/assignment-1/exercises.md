 **Program Definition** : Write a C program that calculates and prints the length of the string `"aeiou"`.

 **Detailed Description** : The program uses standard input/output functions to determine the length of the string `"aeiou"` and display the result on the screen.

Steps:

1. Looping -> what are you looping: "aeiou"
2. Incrementing -> what is being incremented: length of the string
3. Condition -> which condition will make the loop stop: char != 'u'
4. Output after looping -> what is to be printed: length of the string, what is being incremented
