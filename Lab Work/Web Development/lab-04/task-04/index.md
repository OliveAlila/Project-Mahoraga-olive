Scope :
It refers to which variables and functions you can use in your code. It is like a boundary around a specific area of code. You can only access variables and functions within that boundary, unless you pass them to a wider boundary.

Hoisting:
A mechanism which moves variable and function declarations to the top of their containing scope before the code is executed. This means that you can use a variable or call a function before it is actually declared in your code.
