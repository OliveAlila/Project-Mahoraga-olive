Scope:Is the current context of code,which determines the accessibility of variables to JavaScript.
    There are two types of scopes;
        1.Local scope - In which variablea are inside a function or ablock and can only be accessed within that function.
        2.Global scope - Where variabes are declared outside a function or a block and can be accessed from anywhere within the JavaScript code including within functions or blocks.

Hoisting : Is a built-in behaviour of the language through which declarations of functions,variables and classes are moved to the top of their 
           respective scopes before code execution.One can declare and use functions and variables anywhere within their code.
